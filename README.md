An all-in-one hacking tool written in `Python` to remotely exploit Android devices using `ADB` (Android Debug Bridge) and `Metasploit-Framework`.


#### Complete Automation to get a Meterpreter session in One Click

This tool can automatically __Create__, __Install__, and __Run__ payload on the target device using __Metasploit-Framework__ and __ADB__ to completely hack the Android Device in one click if the device has open ADB port `TCP 5555`.

The goal of this project is to make penetration testing on Android devices easy. Now you don't have to learn commands and arguments, PhoneSploit Pro does it for you. Using this tool, you can test the security of your Android devices easily.

> __PhoneSploit Pro__ can also be used as a complete ADB Toolkit to perform various operations on Android devices over Wi-Fi as well as USB. 

# Features 
## v1.0

* Connect device using ADB remotely.
* List connected devices.
* Disconnect all devices.
* Access connected device shell.
* Stop ADB Server.
* Take screenshot and pull it to computer automatically.
* Screen Record target device screen for a specified time and automatically pull it to computer.

  - Automatically create a payload using `msfvenom`, install it, and run it on target device.
  - Then automatically launch and setup __Metasploit-Framework__ to get a `meterpreter` session.
  - Getting a `meterpreter` session means the device is completely hacked using Metasploit-Framework, and you can do anything with it.

# Tutorial


## Setting up Android Phone for the first time

* __Enabling the Developer Options__

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Go to `About Phone`.
3. Find `Build Number`.
4. Tap on `Build Number` 7 times.
5. Enter your pattern, PIN or password to enable the `Developer options` menu.
6. The `Developer options` menu will now appear in your Settings menu.

* __Enabling USB Debugging__

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Go to `System` > `Developer options`.
3. Scroll down and Enable `USB debugging`.

* __Connecting with Computer__

1. Connect your Android device and `adb` host computer to a common Wi-Fi network.
2. Connect the device to the host computer with a USB cable.
3. Open a terminal in the computer and enter the following command :
```
adb devices
```
4. A pop-up will appear in the Android phone when you connect your phone to a new PC for the first time : `Allow USB debugging?`.
5. Click on `Always allow from this computer` check-box and then click `Allow`.
6. Then in the terminal enter the following command :
```
adb tcpip 5555
